Puppet File Management
This document outlines how to manage files using Puppet, including commonly used attributes for controlling file creation, modification, and ownership.

Key Attributes:

path: Defines the file path that Puppet will manage.
ensure: Controls the file's existence. Valid values include:
present: Ensures the file exists.
absent: Deletes the file.
file: Ensures it's a regular file (not a symbolic link or directory).
content: Specifies the content Puppet will write to the file.
owner: Sets the owner of the file (username).
group: Sets the group ownership of the file (group name).
mode: Sets the file permission using octal notation (e.g., '0755') or symbolic notation (e.g., 'rwxr-xr-x').
recurse (optional): Specifies whether Puppet should manage the contents of a directory recursively (including subdirectories and files within).
Example:

Puppet
file { '/tmp/school':
  ensure => present,
  mode   => '0744',
  owner  => 'www-data',
  group  => 'www-data',
  content => "I love Puppet",
}

This example creates a file named /tmp/school with the following properties:

Permissions: 0744 (owner: read, write, execute; group: read, execute; others: read-only)
Owner: User www-data
Group: Group www-data
Content: The string "I love Puppet"
