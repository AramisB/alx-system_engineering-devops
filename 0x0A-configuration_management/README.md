Puppet Resource Management
This document outlines how to manage resources using Puppet, including commonly used attributes for controlling file creation, modification, ownership, package installation, and process execution.

Key Attributes:

path: Defines the file path that Puppet will manage.
ensure: Controls the existence of the file. Valid values include:
present: Ensures the file exists.
absent: Deletes the file.
file: Ensures it's a regular file (not a symbolic link or directory).
content: Specifies the content Puppet will write to the file.
owner: Sets the owner of the file (username).
group: Sets the group ownership of the file (group name).
mode: Sets the file permission using octal notation (e.g., '0755') or symbolic notation (e.g., 'rwxr-xr-x').
recurse (optional): Specifies whether Puppet should manage the contents of a directory recursively (including subdirectories and files within).

Example:

Puppet
file { '/tmp/school':
  ensure => present,
  mode   => '0744',
  owner  => 'www-data',
  group  => 'www-data',
  content => "I love Puppet",
}

This example creates a file named /tmp/school with the following properties:

Permissions: 0744 (owner: read, write, execute; group: read, execute; others: read-only)
Owner: User www-data
Group: Group www-data
Content: The string "I love Puppet"

Package Installation:

Puppet allows you to install, update, and remove software packages on managed systems. Here's how to install a package:

Include the appropriate module: Include a module that provides package management functionalities. Common options include:

python module (for Python packages using pip)
package module (often included by default, offering broader package management)
OS-specific modules (e.g., yum for RedHat-based systems, apt for Debian-based systems)
Define a package resource: Define a resource of type package with the package name and desired attributes.

Set attributes:

name: Name of the package to be installed.
ensure: Desired state of the package (present, absent, latest).
provider (optional): Package provider to use (defaults to system's default).
version (optional): Specific version of the package to install.

Example (Installing Flask 2.1.0 with pip3):

Puppet
# Include the python module
include python

# Define a package resource to install Flask 2.1.0 with pip3
package { 'flask':
  ensure => '2.1.0',
  provider => 'pip3',
}

exec Resource:

The exec resource allows you to execute commands on managed systems during configuration. Here's how to use it:

Define an exec resource: Define a resource of type exec with a descriptive name.

Set attributes:

command: The exact command to be executed.
unless (optional): Command runs only if the specified condition is not met.
onlyif (optional): Command runs only if the specified condition is met.
background (optional): Run the command in the background (recommended for process termination).
refreshonly (optional): Control how the resource reacts to refresh events.

Example (Killing a process named "killmenow" using pkill):

Puppet
# Define an exec resource to kill the process named killmenow
exec { 'kill_killmenow':
  command => '/bin/pkill killmenow',
  background => true,
}
