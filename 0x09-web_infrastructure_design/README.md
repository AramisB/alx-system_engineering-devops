Project: Building a Robust Web Infrastructure
This project explores the concepts and technologies behind building a reliable and scalable web infrastructure.

Core Concepts:
Network Basics: Understand the fundamental building blocks of computer networks, including protocols like TCP/IP that enable communication between devices [Network basics concept page].
Server: A dedicated computer or virtual machine that stores, processes, and delivers data in response to requests. Servers are the backbone of web infrastructure [Server concept page].
Web Server: Software on a server that listens for incoming HTTP requests from web browsers and delivers the requested content (HTML, images, etc.) [Web server concept page].
DNS (Domain Name System): A directory that translates user-friendly domain names (like [invalid URL removed]) into server IP addresses [DNS concept page]. Different DNS record types (e.g., A records, CNAME records) specify how to route traffic [DNS record types].
Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability [Load balancer concept page].
Monitoring: Continuously tracking the health and performance of your web infrastructure to identify and address potential issues before they impact users [Monitoring concept page].
Database: Software that stores and manages structured data for your website (e.g., user accounts, product information) [What is a database].
Web Server vs. Application Server: Web servers deliver static content, while application servers handle dynamic content generated by applications (e.g., PHP scripts) [What's the difference between a web server and an app server?].
Challenges and Solutions:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): A single server failure can bring down the entire website. This can be mitigated by using redundant components like high availability clusters (active-active or active-passive configurations) [Single point of failure, High availability cluster (active-active/active-passive)].
Downtime During Deployment: Restarting web servers for updates can cause downtime. Techniques like blue-green deployments or rolling updates can minimize downtime [How to avoid downtime when deploying new code].
Scalability: A single server may struggle with high traffic. Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers, and cloud platforms offer elastic scaling options.
Security:
HTTPS: Encrypts communication between the user's browser and the server, protecting sensitive data [What is HTTPS].
Firewall: Acts as a security barrier, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic to prevent unauthorized access [What is a firewall].
This project will guide you through building a robust web infrastructure with these concepts in mind. The goal is to create a website that is reliable, scalable, and secure.
