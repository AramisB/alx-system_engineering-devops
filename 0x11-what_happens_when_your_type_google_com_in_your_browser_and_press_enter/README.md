Understanding the Web: A Guide to DNS Lookup, HTTPS, and Secure Connections
Introduction
In the vast landscape of the internet, ensuring secure connections is paramount. This guide aims to demystify three crucial components of secure web browsing: DNS lookup, HTTPS, and SSL/Digital Certificates.

DNS Lookup
DNS (Domain Name System) lookup is the process by which your browser translates user-friendly domain names, like "google.com", into numerical IP addresses that computers understand. Understanding DNS is essential as it forms the backbone of how we access websites on the internet.

HTTPS
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website you're connected to. HTTPS encrypts communication, protecting your data from potential eavesdropping and manipulation by malicious actors.

SSL/Digital Certificates
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and digital certificates play a pivotal role in establishing the legitimacy of a website and ensuring a secure connection. Digital certificates verify a website's identity, safeguarding you from imposters and ensuring the integrity of your online interactions.
