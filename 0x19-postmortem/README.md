In the world of tech, two key documents help teams learn from disruptions and outages: incident reports and postmortems. Both are crucial for improving how things run. Here's a breakdown of each:

Incident Report:

Think of it as an immediate account of a technical problem.
It focuses on the "what" and "when" - what went wrong, when it happened, and the impact it had.
It documents the chronology of events, including how the incident was identified, how it was resolved, and when normal operations resumed.
Postmortem:

This is a deeper dive into the incident, conducted after things have settled down.
It goes beyond the "what" and "when" to focus on the "why" - why did the incident happen in the first place?
It involves analyzing the root causes, uncovering any weaknesses in the system or process that contributed to the issue.
The goal is to identify actionable steps to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
Postmortems are typically a collaborative effort involving everyone who played a part in resolving the incident.
Here's an analogy: Imagine a car breaks down. The incident report is like the initial call to the mechanic, describing the symptoms (flat tire, dead battery). The postmortem is the mechanic's full diagnosis, explaining why the problem occurred (worn tread, faulty alternator) and how to prevent future breakdowns (tire rotation, battery replacement).

By creating both reports, tech teams can ensure they learn from their mistakes and continuously improve their systems and processes.
