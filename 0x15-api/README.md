Friends Donâ€™t Let Friends Program in Shell Script
Shell scripting can be powerful but is often error-prone and difficult to debug. It lacks the structure and robustness of modern programming languages. Encouraging the use of more reliable and maintainable languages for complex tasks can lead to better code quality and fewer bugs.

What is an API?
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications use to exchange information.

What is a REST API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that follows a set of constraints for creating web services. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and operate with stateless communication, which means each request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. REST APIs typically use JSON or XML for data interchange.

What Are Microservices?
Microservices are an architectural style where a software application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each microservice focuses on a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, leading to more flexible and maintainable systems.

PEP8 Python Style Guide
Having a Clean Code Respecting Style Guide is Really Appreciated in the Industry
Adhering to style guides like PEP8 in Python ensures that code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across different projects and teams. It is a best practice that is highly valued in the software development industry.

What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For
Bash scripting should not be used for complex applications that require extensive error handling, scalability, and maintainability. For such tasks, using a more robust language like Python, Java, or C++ is recommended.

What is the CSV Format?
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line in a CSV file represents a data record, and each record consists of fields separated by commas.

What is the JSON Format?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is built on two structures: a collection of key/value pairs (often implemented as an object, hash table, or dictionary) and an ordered list of values (often implemented as an array, list, or sequence).

Pythonic Naming Conventions
1. Package and Module Name Style
Use short, all-lowercase names.
Prefer underscores over hyphens if needed.
Example: my_package, utility_module.

2. Class Name Style
Use CapWords convention (also known as CamelCase).
Each word starts with a capital letter.
Example: MyClass, UserProfile.

3. Variable Name Style
Use all-lowercase letters with words separated by underscores.
Example: user_name, total_count.

4. Function Name Style
Use all-lowercase letters with words separated by underscores.
Example: get_user_name(), calculate_total().

5. Constant Name Style
Use all-uppercase letters with words separated by underscores.
Example: MAX_USERS, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT.

Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
CapWords or CamelCase is a naming convention in Python where the first letter of each word is capitalized, and there are no underscores between words. This style is typically used for class names and helps distinguish class names from other types of identifiers, enhancing code readability and organization.
