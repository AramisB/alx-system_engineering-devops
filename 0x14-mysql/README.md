Database Management and Backups
This document provides an introduction to database concepts, primary-replica clusters, building a robust backup strategy, the mysqldump command, and verification procedures.

Understanding Databases:
A database is a structured collection of data for efficient access, retrieval, and manipulation. It's the core of many applications, storing critical information.

Database Replicas (Secondaries):
These are copies of a primary database, used for various purposes:
Read Scalability: Offloading read operations, improving performance.
Disaster Recovery: Providing a readily available copy for restoration.
Backup and Archiving: Facilitating backups without impacting primary performance.

Primary-Replica Clusters:
A high-availability architecture where one server (primary) accepts writes and replicates changes to replicas (secondaries).

Benefits:
Scalability: Handles increased workloads effectively.
High Availability: Minimal downtime during failures by promoting a replica.
Fault Tolerance: Provides redundancy in case of server outages.

Building a Robust Database Backup Strategy:
Regular Backups: Create periodic database backups to a separate location.
Backup Rotation: Implement a rotation scheme (daily/weekly/monthly) to maintain a history.
Offsite Storage: Store backups offsite for disaster recovery (e.g., online backups, cloud storage).
Backup Verification: Regularly test backups and perform restore drills to validate recoverability.

The mysqldump Command:
A MySQL command-line utility to create logical backups of a database in SQL format.
Common Flags:
-u <username>: MySQL username for authentication.
-p: Prompt for the MySQL password.
-h <hostname>: Specify the MySQL server hostname.
-P <port>: Port number (default: 3306).
--databases <database_name>: Back up a specific database.
-t <table_name>: Back up a specific table.
-o <output_file>: Specify the output filename for the backup dump.

Example Usage:
mysqldump -u root -p my_database > my_database_backup.sql

Verifying Your Backup Strategy:
Regularly restore backups to a test environment to ensure data integrity and successful recovery in case of failure.
